This week I worked on refactoring the database, creating helper classes to down/up-load documents and adding constants to easily create paths for objects in the database. The work has been smooth, the only issues have been about merging other PRs and adapting the code a lot because there have been multiple PRs opened in parallel and that worked on the same files.
Other than that I made minor UI changes and added a functionality to open ad image fullscreen, so that we can see the whole photo instead of only the square-cropped version. These features weren't hard to implement, they just required a bit of doc reading to learn about gesture detectors and such.
Overall it's been a good week and I feel like there's not much to improve about it, only the communication with other members to better organize the flow between different PRs.
