# Summary of week 2

## Antoine

This week I worked on implementing the login logic behind the login UI. It was quite involved as I had to rewrite part of the LoginService interface and add a few things to the UI. I learned to test with espresso. Lorenzo worked on the AdViewModel due to the fact the UI was taking me too much time. In total I spend a lot more than 8 hours the login implementation and when I decided to work on it I didn't expect that. I think hat this week brought me a lot of experience concerning work estimations. I did not manage to finish the ViewModel but I will continue to work on it this week.

## Carlo
This week I worked on implementing the User Profile UI and the user update. The user can now edit its personal information (e.g. name, age, phone number, gender) and the UI will store the new updated information in a local AppUser. Furthermore I refactored the User interface and the AppUser class to meet the new architecture. Unfortunately the new features were not merged because tests were missing. The goals of next week will be to coordinate with Emilien and Filippo for the defiling menu and the User Profile back-end respectively. Furthermore add tests to my implementation and add the possibility of accessing the gallery or the camera to set/modify the profile picture. After this I will be able to merge my PR. I will also take on a new, maybe smaller, task if necessary.


## Ã‰milien (scrum master)
My task this week was to add a way of accessing the user UI that Carlo is implementing. I did this by adding a toolbar to the appli. Now there is a few options in this menu bar, but few of them are useful for now. In perticular, I wasn't able to link the account button to the user UI, as we haven't merged the user UI to the master branch in time. This should be easily fixable for next week though, so this won't be an issue for long. There is also a settings button and a logout button in the toolbar. The first is useless for now, and the second just takes the user to the login page, without actually loging out. This is something we could do next week, as there is currently no way to log out of your account.


## Filippo
This week I work to implement the ViewModel for the Profile UI, so when a user edit the its personal information its directly comunicate with the database. I add some new functionality to the database for to allow saving, modify, getting user information and comunicate with the viewmodel. I din't merge in the master branch my task because were missing some feature for the User Interface and some issue for testing the database, but by the end of the weekend everything should be ready.



## Lorenzo
This week I worked on the UI of the AdActivity. While it was fun to work on UI, it's been very time consuming because of several reasons: I had to learn my way around android views, and my work was stalled by the viewmodel so I had to spend time harcoding stuff in order to test the UI. I also helped Antoine work on the logic for the AdActivity.
For the reasons above I ended up spending much more time than the estimate on this sprint, but without those issues I think the estimate wasn't too off.
Thinking back on it, it would have been better to directly help Antoine on the viewmodel right away instead of spending time hardcoding stuff in order to test the UI.

## Quentin

I worked on dependency injection this week. I decided to go with hilt and setup the last version. I had to read all the documentation on google developper since the sdp tutorial is about an anciant 
version and is no longer the same.
Using hilt enabled us to mock the database and therefore to solve the espresso tests not passing last week due to a timing issue. It also makes more sense in the code as now only actitvities that need an injected class are consious about it. 
I also modified the interface of database to use futur. It made it more concise and readable both in the client code and in the database implementation itself. 
A key missing feature is a mock for the login. We are currently using the Emulator or the cloud service but I fill like a mock could allow us to test the ui without worrying about timings. I suggested that we get the three implementations : MockLoginService, CloudLoginService. The cloud one could transparantly use the emulator or not. I think its better because in my opinion the emulator is a system as a whole and should not interfer in our logic tests.
