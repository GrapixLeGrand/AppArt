# Summary of week 1

## Antoine (scrum master)
This week I worked on the login backend and the login logic. The login backend has been ready for quite a while but was not mergeable due to the total test coverage being too low for the whole project. I also worked with Emilien and Carlo on implementing the login logic for the UI and a create account panel. This also works fine but is not part of any branch for now because some things need to be perfected like the popup window we want to appear on login failure and the handling of several other types of failures. We also need to write some tests for this part. I also spent a lot of time discussing the architecture for the login backend (the discussion is in the PR), and reviewing several of my teammates pull requests. I under estimated the work to be done by quite a margin. This was due in part, by not taking into account the need for tests. However, most of the time was spent re-implementing the backend several time until a suitable structure / architecture was found.

Next week I plan on merge the login backend and login logic for the UI into the master branch. Also, I will work on the Ad ViewModel.

I was in charge of setting up Firebase as back-end of of app. I then worked with Filippo on the implementation of the models and logic related to the ScrollingActivity. This inlcuded the database classes for the communication with Firestore. We then worked with the help of Quentin on the implementation of the scrolling ViewModel.
The time estimate for the task was slightly optimistic but not too far off. On my side I spent a bit too much time going over PRs. Quite some time was also spent on setting up dependencies for the project. The PR merge ended up being late because of difficulties finding a way to unit test the database.
Starting week two I will try spending my time more efficiently on PRs and maximizing individual work.
