This week I worked on the UI of the AdActivity. While it was fun to work on UI, it's been very time consuming because of several reasons: I had to learn my way around android views, and my work was stalled by the viewmodel so I had to spend time harcoding stuff in order to test the UI. I also helped Antoine work on the logic for the AdActivity.
For the reasons above I ended up spending much more time than the estimate on this sprint, but without those issues I think the estimate wasn't too off.
Thinking back on it, it would have been better to directly help Antoine on the viewmodel right away instead of spending time hardcoding stuff in order to test the UI.
