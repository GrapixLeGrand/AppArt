This week I work on several different task. First I finish the filter activity. Now the user can filter the ads by price and by location range or reset simply all filter. Secondly, I implemented the redirection on a phone call or on the email when the user want contact the advertiser. I choose to redirect automatically on the mail (that is mandatory for use the app) if the advertiser don’t have a phone number. If the advertiser have the two (mail and phone number) an alert box is show and the user can decide which of two contact redirection choose. As a last thing I continued the work on the design refactor making small change, in particular I update the standard margin in some activity for let adapt activity with the size of the screen phone, and change some font button.
