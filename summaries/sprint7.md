# Summary of week 6

## Antoine

## Carlo

## Ã‰milien

## Filippo (scrum master)
This week I worked on several parts. First of all, I added the possibility to use the application with Launch Options that allow you to automate the login on the emulator. Secondly I finished the CameraActivity which can be used in different situations. Finally I worked with Lorenzo, Carlo to allow you to add photos to your Ad or your Profile. For the moment we have found a solution to manage the database when we store an Ad but in the coming weeks we will have to do a refactor.

## Overall team
This week we worked on several components of the application. In general we continued the work with the tour overview by offering the possibility to create a parkour, synchronized the creation of the announcements with the database and offered the possibility to see a map.
