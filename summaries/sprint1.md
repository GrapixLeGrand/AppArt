I was in charge of setting up Firebase as back-end of of app. I then worked with Filippo on the implementation of the models and logic related to the ScrollingActivity. This inlcuded the database classes for the communication with Firestore. We then worked with the help of Quentin on the implementation of the scrolling ViewModel.
The time estimate for the task was slightly optimistic but not too far off. On my side I spent a bit too much time going over PRs. Quite some time was also spent on setting up dependencies for the project. The PR merge ended up being late because of difficulties finding a way to unit test the database.
Starting week two I will try spending my time more efficiently on PRs and maximizing individual work.
