# Summary of week 3

## Antoine

This week I worked on the backend required for the AnnounceActivity ViewModel. This consisted in fetching the adId from the cardId passed to the activity and then retrieving the information for the corresponding ad. I also needed to implement the log out back end when the toolbar was finished but this it isn't merged yet. Next week, I plan on refactoring some classes, adding tests and improve the login UI.

This week I worked on the CameraActivity. In practice I have implemented an activity that allows the use of the camera for take picture and allows the access at the gallery to take the image. Before the user can access to the camera/gallery permission is asked. Communication with the database must be implemented in the coming weeks.
