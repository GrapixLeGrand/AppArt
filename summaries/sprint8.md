# Summary of week 8

## Antoine (scrum master)

This week I worked on two features. First, I tried to improve the map functionality. I managed to improve the UI of the card that appears when you click on a marker on a map. Also, I changed the way we retrieve locations from String since the previous way was not stable enough. Then, I started the work on the local database reading and writing. This consists mostly in handling how to store the information about an ad on disk and how to then get it back when we are offline. I plan to continue and finish this work for next week.

Unfortunately, most of my work was slowed down by the issues with cirrus.

## Overall team

This week the team communicated very well. We tried to help each other when dealing with Cirrus issues, which affected all of us. Even though this week was tough, the team managed to produce a great amount of work despite the situation. I hope we manage to fix these issues so we can continue to progress on the app.
