# Summary of week 8

## Quentin

## Carlo

## Antoine

This week I worked on the local database. First, I startes to think about the archtiecture and discussed it a lot with Lorenzo. He helped me design the API. Then, I worked on the implementation which took me quite a lot of time. I didn't plan on the local database being so large and complex to write. I managed to get it to a ready for review state Thursday. Then, Lorenzo and Quentin reviewed it very well. For next week, I will work on the suggestions they left and their requests. The whole local databse and online/offline synchronization (Lorenzo's part) should be done by the end of the next sprint.

In my opinion, Lorenzo and I managed to communicate very well on the local database issues to build something that would be actually usable not only by me but by the others member of the team, especially Lorenzo.

## Filippo

## Lorenzo
I kept on working on the logic for linking server and local database. I finished laying down the code, now I only need the localDB api code from Antoine and the tests on the PR, and my task will be then finished.
THere has been really good communication between Antoined and I for the structure of the lcoalDB, he put a lot of effort into writing code that could be easily usable by me. I really appreciated him taking the time to go off his ideas so that we could settle on a design that would fit the need of both.

## Ã‰milien (scrum master)

This week I worked on multiple things. First, I finished merging the favorites feature. It is now fully tested and implemented. Then, I worked on a new feature: an activity where the user can see the ads they have posted. This has been done and now needs just a bit more of testing. Finally, I also worked on an issue with the ad creation, as they were crashes happening when trying to create an ad without any picture. This too has been fully done and now just needs to be merged.
