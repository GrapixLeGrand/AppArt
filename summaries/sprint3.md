# Summary of week 3

## Antoine

This week I worked on the backend required for the AnnounceActivity ViewModel. This consisted in fetching the adId from the cardId passed to the activity and then retrieving the information for the corresponding ad. I also needed to implement the log out back end when the toolbar was finished but this it isn't merged yet. Next week, I plan on refactoring some classes, adding tests and improve the login UI.

This week I finished and merged the user profile activity. A large chunk of my time was utilised to re-create the user profile layout since the previous implementation did not adapt to all screen sizes and elements in the layout popped out of the view once the emulatore changed. The activity is now implemented and a user can edit its personal information on the app. Next week I will add interaction with the FirebaseDB class which updates information inside Firestore database so that editing is persistent. Furthermore I will create a SimpleUserProfileActivity: this activity will be used on the ads to enable the user to see all public information on the announcers profile.


## Ã‰milien
This week I finished the adding of the toolbar. It was really tedious, as there was various bugs that I had to find and delete. This took most of my time, as new errors kept emerging when I fixed the previous ones. I also refactored some of the code, to implement the idea that an activity has a toolbar. Thus, all activities fitting that description will have the same behaviour, thus removing some duplicate code.


## Filippo
This week I worked on the CameraActivity. In practice I have implemented an activity that allows the use of the camera for take picture and allows the access at the gallery to take the image. Before the user can access to the camera/gallery permission is asked. Communication with the database must be implemented in the coming weeks.
