# Summary of week 4

## Overall team
This week there was really no individual work to point out. As a team we had a refactor meeting and then selected and completed different refactoring tasks for each one of us. This refactoring had to do with code base, documentation and naming conventions. All these improvements have been merged within the following [Pull Request](https://github.com/SDPepe/AppArt/pull/108).
