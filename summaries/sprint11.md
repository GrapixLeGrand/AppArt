This week I work on several different task. First I finish the filter activity. Now the user can filter the ads by price and by location range or reset simply all filter. Secondly, I implemented the redirection on a phone call or on the email when the user want contact the advertiser. I choose to redirect automatically on the mail (that is mandatory for use the app) if the advertiser don’t have a phone number. If the advertiser have the two (mail and phone number) an alert box is show and the user can decide which of two contact redirection choose. As a last thing I continued the work on the design refactor making small change, in particular I update the standard margin in some activity for let adapt activity with the size of the screen phone, and change some font button.

This week I finally finished my task on the syncrhonization between server and local database. Now the user can login automatically if they didn't log out during the previous session, and also the offline login is working. When opening the favorite activity the ads are saved locally and can be accessed offline too (with images and info about the advertiser). Despite being very tight on time this week I had the feeling of spending my work time well and in a very productive way. The meetings were good and quick.
