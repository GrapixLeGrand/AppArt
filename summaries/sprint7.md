# Summary of week 6

## Antoine
This week I worked on the map features of the app. It actually consists in two separate features. First, we want the user to be able to see all ads on a map, and click on the markers to get the relevant informations. Secondly, we want the user to be able to see the location of an ad on the ad page. For now, this is done through a see location button that launches an entirely different activity but the end goal is to have it directly on the ad page. 

I didn't realize implementing this would take me so long. I had to create a location service, which I didn't plan to add at first, and get familiar with the Google maps APIs.

Right now, the UI is not nice looking and not particularly user friendly but I think this can be improved quite easily.

## Filippo (scrum master)
This week I worked on several parts. First of all, I added the possibility to use the application with Launch Options that allow you to automate the login on the emulator. Secondly I finished the CameraActivity which can be used in different situations. Finally I worked with Lorenzo, Carlo to allow you to add photos to your Ad or your Profile. For the moment we have found a solution to manage the database when we store an Ad but in the coming weeks we will have to do a refactor.

## Overall team
This week we worked on several components of the application. In general we continued the work with the tour overview by offering the possibility to create a parkour, synchronized the creation of the announcements with the database and offered the possibility to see a map.
