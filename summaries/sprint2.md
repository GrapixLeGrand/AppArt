# Summary of week 2

## Antoine

This week I worked on implementing the login logic behind the login UI. It was quite involved as I had to rewrite part of the LoginService interface and add a few things to the UI. I learned to test with espresso. Lorenzo worked on the AdViewModel due to the fact the UI was taking me too much time. In total I spend a lot more than 8 hours the login implementation and when I decided to work on it I didn't expect that. I think hat this week brought me a lot of experience concerning work estimations.

This week I worked on the UI of the AdActivity. While it was fun to work on UI, it's been very time consuming because of several reasons: I had to learn my way around android views, and my work was stalled by the viewmodel so I had to spend time harcoding stuff in order to test the UI. I also helped Antoine work on the logic for the AdActivity.
For the reasons above I ended up spending much more time than the estimate on this sprint, but without those issues I think the estimate wasn't too off.
Thinking back on it, it would have been better to directly help Antoine on the viewmodel right away instead of spending time hardcoding stuff in order to test the UI.
