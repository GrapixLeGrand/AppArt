# Summary of week 10

This week I implemented the step counter activity. 
This activity introduces **sensor usage** in AppArt by counting the number of steps done by the user from when the start button was pressed. The main issue that was faced during this procedure was **making the step counter as more accurate/flexible as possible**. For example, the step counter still gets updated when the user pauses the activity by using the phone for other scopes, or when the user finishes the activity by navigating elsewhere on the app. Also it was managed the possiblility that the STEP_DETECTOR sensor could be missing on the device. In this case the user is informed and a less accurate implementation of the steps can still be computed using only the STEP_COUNTER sensor (which is available in almost all current androids). This progress was merged.
