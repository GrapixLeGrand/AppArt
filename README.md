# AppArt

A marketplace for university students looking for and renting apartments.

The aim of this application is to create a trusted and self-organised market place where university students may search for apartment rentals in Switzerland. It frequently happens in a student’s life that a substitute candidate is required by the leaseholder once the rental contract terminates or that rooms or studios remain empty for a large and contiguous part of the year. This self-organised market place would be a platform for students to broadcast their offers to find or rent their rooms or apartments.
The main feature which distinguishes this idea from a basic apartment market place is that it’s narrowed to university-related users: this both provides a friendly and trusted place for users to feel comfortable with their experience of the app.
